This Java code allows users to add, remove, and show a list of cosmetics. The code first checks the user's login credentials. If the user is logged in, they can then add a new cosmetic by entering the cosmetic's name, generic name, company name, expiry date, price, and total quantity. The code then writes the new cosmetic to a file.
